# CS5610 Final Project RecipeFridge

RecipeFridge is an application that allows you to view and save recipes from other users on the app, or create your own recipe. You can even search for recipes based on ingredients in your refrigerator!

## Running this app locally

Running the application locally entails running both the backend service and a frontend.

## Starting the backend
You can start it in main branch of the `webdev-final-project-node` directory by running `npm run start`
(the first time you run it, you will also need to run `npm install`).

## Running the frontend
In the main branch of the `webdev-final-project-react` directory, run `npm start` (you'll need to run
`npm install` the very first time you run it). After several moments (or minutes, depending on the
speed of your machine), a browser will open with the frontend running locally. The frontend will
automatically re-compile and reload in your browser if you change any files in the
`webdev-final-project-react/src` directory.
